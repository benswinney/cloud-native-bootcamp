# CP4BA Install

## Manual Install
### 1. Official docs
[IBM Official Docs](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cp-biz-automation/22.0.1?topic=automation-installing)
### 2. Dave Wakeman notes
> Note: there are multiple places on Dave's site where he goes over installs for Cloud Pak for Business Automation. Unsuprisingly, there is a lot of overlap between the two. While attempting to install ODM & ADS, I did run into errors with the navigator database.
